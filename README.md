## About Me :sunglasses:

##### Hi! My name is Anthony Nadeau :bowtie:
###### My pronouns are He/Him

I'm currently a Computer Engineering student at the university level.
Recently, I completed my technical DCS (equivalent to an associates degree) in Computer Science.
In this program, I dedicated 3 years to learning the ins-and-outs of the software development world.
Over these 3 years I studied various aspects of Computer Science such as:

- Software Development (Java, C#, Python, and more)
- Network Design and Administration
- Database Design and Administration (SQL, phpmyadmin, noSQL such as Firebase, etc.)
- IoT Systems Design
- App Development for Android and Windows
- Unix systems use and manipulation
- Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP)
- Game Development in Unity
- Cybersecurity
And tons of other stuff!

I'm a strong supporter of **FLOSS** projects and ideas, and I'd love to involve myself in more of them in the future.
All in all, I'm a tech enthusiast at heart, and this field is truly my greatest passion. :heart:

## My Profile :bulb:
##### My profile is very **structured**
My main repositories are separated by semester.  
Each one shows the significant works I completed during my time studying in that semester.  
I believe it shows my evolution and progression as a software developer quite nicely! I hope you'll think so as well. :smiley:

## So now... What am I working on :grey_question:
 
My current priority is to explore topics outside of what was taught in my lessons at school. :mortar_board:

I'm seeking to improve drastrically in front-end web development, with more practice in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'd also like to familiarize myself more with AJAX, JQuery, and the REACT framework.

Aside from web development I'm also beginning to explore the worlds of
- AI development in Python
- General app development with Flutter
- Data Oriented programming with Rust
And really anything else I can find time for :star2:
